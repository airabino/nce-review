Network Capacity Expansion code for reviewers of

"Improving the Charging Experience for Long-Trip Travel: Investigating the effects of Structure on the performance of DC Charging Networks"

submission in TRE. The eventual release package remains a work in progress and this repository contains a minimum set of functionality to verify the method and demonstrate it's implementation without dependencies on other author packages.

## Random Graph Example

Please see Random_Graph.ipynb. This notebook generates a random connected graph representative of a high-level road network and runs the capacity expansion code.

## Paper Graph Example

Please see San_Joaquin_Corridor.ipynb. This notebook runs the capacity expansion code on the network used in the paper.
